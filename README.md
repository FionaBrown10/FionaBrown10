- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FionaBrown10
-I'm new to Github and have found lots of great Arduino sketches that I'd like to run, but I can't seem to find any circuit diagrams.   Many of the sketches I'm interested in have handfuls and handfuls of switches and leds, but without a circuit the sketch is meaningless.

Where can I find actual traditional circuit diagrams ?

Thank you for any help you can provide.
Regards
Fiona
